# Flask with mysql project
In this project we are gonna build a super simple app commit bt commit, to learn the basic of flask with mysql.
The project is conducted on mac M1.

### Prerequisite
- python3
- mysql (see __mysql-installation.md__ to install mysql on mac M1)

Let's start with installing flask-
```bash
pip3 install flask
```
Then we need flask-mysqldb package-
```bash
pip3 install flask-mysqldb
```

To run __app.py__-
```bash
python3 app.py
```

Now if we go to __localhost:5000__, we can see that it says __Not Found The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.__

After adding the route, it will say __Hello World__
